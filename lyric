Yeah, yeah, word up
(Yeah, son)
Yeah, yo, how this goin' down nine six
How we livin' son?
(Exoticness)

Nine six exoticness
(Representin')
Know what I mean?
(A+)

(Yo how we livin'?)
This is New York City
Ninety seven Sosa
A to Z up in the spot representin'

Takin' it back from here, it's supposed to be
Takin' ya back son take it back, check it

Six digit trickin' coke and henny mixin', many listen
Fuckin' give me mine, don't wanna see no penny missin'
Its old tradition how we click and fall in position
The rap coalition, we gettin' rich an'

Poetically I'm deadly like a crucifixion, Buddha addiction
Dismissin' competition when they roll wit' friction
My whole crew be schemin' flippy like ixing for that chicken
Smith brothas and A on ya Mason Dixon

Who want the steel cap feel the real rap
Patiently my whole crew waited and we rock premeditated
Chucked underground like the rap genie
And watch the shore by the rising tide now the whole world can see me

When they get foul that's when my style gets wild
I hang a man in front of a crowd without a trial
KAPOW, yo that's all she wrote end the quote
For frontin' a brotha got a dome and his legs broke

Six digit trickin' coke and henny mixin', many listen
Fuckin' give me mine, don't wanna see no penny missin'
Its old tradition how we click and fall in position
The rap coalition, we gettin' rich an'

Yeah son, I want it all your crib, cars and beepers
Wit hundred dollar sneakers, my sounds blowin' ya speakers
Burgundy Land Cruisers chrome rims on blue rugers
Lyrical hollow tip slug point trugers

Yo yo yo drug connects, diamond cut bergets drippin' wet
My hole is there from Quebec, got her flippin' checks
What, I push a black Lex with gold on my neck
You rockin' wit' a vest tryin' to catch a hole in ya chest

Firm official, exotic girl but wanna be the ritual
Leavin' lights shine light they've been psyched to slip through
I will abolish, MCs get straight up demolished
Yo my mind is like a nine, I load it up wit' knowledge

Six digit trickin' coke and henny mixin', many listen
Fuckin' give me mine, don't wanna see no penny missin'
Its old tradition how we click and fall in position
The rap coalition, we gettin' rich an'

Six digit trickin' coke and henny mixin', many listen

Its old tradition how we click and fall in position

The realism must continue, where I live is like a battlefield
We all poor but on my block is like a half a mil
Surrounded by the most criminal type of elements
Blunts, stunts, gunshots, broken down developments

It's all illegal, young juveniles wit the desert eagles
Street sweepers, heaters, soon to be retreaters
Its routine, people seem to go through a cycle
So confused, to choose between the Bible or the rifle

Watch em stifle, yo, me an son gone escalate this
And get these papers run some capers while they catch the vapors
Yeah son, don't got no time for no chicken trickin'
It's the lyrical addiction, 'cause me an AZ be politikin'

Six digit trickin' coke and henny mixin', many listen
Fuckin' give me mine, don't wanna see no penny missin'
Its old tradition how we click and fall in position

Owner Of A Lonely Heart

*********

Move yourself, you always lived your life
Never thinking of the future
Prove yourself, you are the move you make
Take a chance, win or lose

See yourself, you are the steps you take
You and you and that's the only way
Shake, shake yourself, you're every move you make
So the story goes

Owner of a lonely heart
Owner of a lonely heart much better than a
Owner of a broken heart
Owner of a lonely heart

Say, you don't want to chance it
You've been hurt so before
Watch it now, the eagle in the sky
How he dancin' one and only

You lose yourself
No, not for pity's sake
There's no real reason to be lonely

Be yourself
Give your free will a chance
You've got to want to succeed

Owner of a lonely heart
Owner of a lonely heart
(Much better than a)
Owner of a broken heart
Owner of a lonely heart
Owner of a lonely heart

After my own indecision they confused me so
My love said never question your will at all
In the end you've got to go look before you leap
And don't you hesitate at all

Owner of a lonely heart
Owner of a lonely heart
(Much better than a)
Owner of a broken heart
Owner of a lonely heart

Sooner or later each conclusion
Will decide the lonely heart, yes, it will
It will excite it will delight
It will give a better start

Don't deceive your free will at all
Don't deceive your free will at all
Don't deceive your free will at all
Just receive it, just receive it

Don't deceive your free will at all
Don't deceive your free will at all
Don't deceive your free will at all
Just receive it, just receive it

Going Down

*********

Suck it up, going down
30 seconds till we smash into the ground
Passengers, have lost their smiles
Soon their bodies will be wreckage spread for miles

I'm in the shit, knee-deep in it
I know that this might hurt a bit
I leave my debts but no regrets
Except I wish I took the train

Another day, another flight
There's not a chance of going down
But then we just might, so this is it, this is goodbye
And I feel like I'm gonna lose my mind

I'm in the shit, knee-deep in it
I know that this might hurt a bit
I leave my debts but no regrets
Except I wish I took the train

Everybody has their day and I guess I'm just the same
But I'm going nowhere
Everybody has their day, never thought it would be this way
And I really don't care

I'm in the shit, knee-deep in it
I know that this might hurt a bit
I leave my debts but no regrets
Except I wish I took the train

We're going down, we're out of sky
It sure helps if you can see the funny side
So this is over and out, this is goodbye
And I'm feeling like I'm gonna lose my mind

I try to reach her, but she's not there
But back home I hope she knows how much I care
I ease the seat back and start to pray
To the same God that puts bombs in cargo bays
